# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The project uses OOP principles to create modular and reusable code.

# Examples of OOP in the Quiz Web App:

Classes: Represent entities like Quiz, Question, or User. For instance:
The Quiz class might include properties such as title, questions, and methods like addQuestion() or calculateScore().
Inheritance: Subclasses like AdminUser extending the base User class.
Encapsulation: Keeping internal states private (e.g., quiz scoring logic) and exposing only necessary methods to interact with them.
Polymorphism: Implementing different question types (e.g., multiple-choice and true/false) that share a common interface or base class. 2. Creating and Handling DOM Elements Dynamically
This involves manipulating the HTML structure programmatically using JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience.

# Enables users to experience diverse quiz formats, such as:

Multiple-Choice: Select one or more correct answers.
True/False: Binary choice questions for quick assessments.
Short-Answer: Fill-in-the-blank or open-ended questions.
